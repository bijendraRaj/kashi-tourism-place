    <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">The Ganga aarti of Varanasi is a shining beacon of devotion and bliss that makes us experience the divinity in and around us. Since ages, no day has gone by when the holy Ganga River has not been adored. It is one of the must-see activities included in every traveller’s itinerary, and people from all walks of life visit the city with the desire of beholding the Ganga aarti.The priests in-charge of performing the aarti sport dhoti and kurta well-tied with a long gamcha (or towel). They prepare the set-up by gathering five elevated planks, a layered brass lamp, idol of Ganga Devi, flowers, incense sticks, conch shell and other ritual paraphernalia. Eager devotees throng the site from across the city to witness the awe-inspiring spectacle; many others take a boat ride from the opposite banks of Ganga River and get the boat parked on the banks of Dashashwamedh ghat. Only the learned pundits of Vedas and Upanishads are involved in performing the aarti, and they are headed by the priest of Gangotri Seva Samiti.

    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Manikarnika Ghat is one of the oldest ghats in Varanasi and has been accorded the highest position among other ghats by the holy scriptures in Hinduism. It is believed that if a person is cremated here, he immediately attains moksha (salvation). It is bound on both sides by the Scindia Ghat and Dashashwamedh Ghat.  Like all the other ghats in Varanasi, the Manikarnika Ghat is surrounded by a fascinating mythological story which also tells us how it acquired its name. It is believed that when Goddess Adi Shakti, or Goddess Sati, jumped into the fire and immolated herself, Lord Shiva carried her burning body to the Himalayas. There, he was immersed in unending sorrow. Lord Vishnu, moved by his plight, sent forth his Divine Chakra (one of his weapons) which cut Goddess Adi Shakti’s body into 51 pieces. Each of the place where her pieces fell on Earth were declared as a Shakti Peeth. Because her earrings fell at this ghat, it was established as a Shakti Peeth and named Manikarnika since Manikarna in Sanskrit means ear rings.</p>

    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Dashashwamedh Ghat is the main ghat in Varanasi on the Ganga River in Uttar Pradesh. It is located close to Vishwanath Temple and is probably the most spectacular ghat. Two Hindu legends are associated with it: according to one, Brahma created it to welcome Shiva, and in another, Brahma sacrificed ten horses during Dasa-Ashwamedha yajna performed here.

        The present ghat was built by Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao in the year 1748. A few decades later, Ahilyabahi Holkar, the Queen of Indore rebuilt the ghat in the year 1774.[1] Close to the ghat, overlooking the Ganga lies the Jantar Mantar, an observatory built by Maharaja Jai Singh of Jaipur in the year 1737.</p>

    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">In the northern side of the upper part there is a temple of Brahmacarini Durga (no. K 22/ 17), from where the name of the ghat derived, i.e. Durga Ghat. The 17th century text, Giravana-padamanjari has described this ghat. In 1742 Narayana dikshita, a guru of Peshvas, had purchased land from local resident fishermen and built two ghat: Durga and succeeding one, Brahma Ghats. This was rebuilt and repaired in 1830 by Nana Phadanavisa, a finance secretary (Divan) of Gwalior Estate, whose building at the top of the ghat is known as Phadanivisa Wada. At the ghat exist the two water-front sacred spots, i.e. Markandeya and Kharva Narasimha Tirthas, and at the top is the shrine of Kharva Narasimha. In 1958 the government of Uttar Pradesh has repaired and rebuilt the ghat. The steps from the ghat leading to the upper part are built in an archetypal frame, i.e. after nine steps there lies a platform, the steps symbolise the nine forms of Durga. This ghat is an active place for religious festivities, and also for annual competition of fighting, wrestling and mettle in the month of Karttika (October/November).</p>
